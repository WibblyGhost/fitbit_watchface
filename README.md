# FitBit Watch Face

This is just a simple project I made so that I could have a well designed FitBit watch face for my personal device. I found many FitBit faces were just badly designed and felt cluttered, plus I wanted to incorporate a more New Zealand themed background of mountain snow berries.

## Install

To install the FitBit clockface:
1. `npm install` - Install packages
2. `npx fitbit-build` - Build Packages
3. `npx fitbit` - Open FitBit terminal
4. `$fitbit bi` - Build & Install
5. `$fitbit connect device` - Connect to FitBit watch
6. `$fitbit bi` - Sideloading clock app to FitBit watch
